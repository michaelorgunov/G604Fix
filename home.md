## Double Click
This is not my first Logitech mouse and they all seem to develop double clicking over time. I have previously taken the switch apart to bend back the contact on the G602. However, for the G604 I wanted to try something besides Omron. 

I bought some Black Kailh GM 8.0 switches on Amazon to be the replacement. Taking apart the G604 requires taking a LOT of screws out, so if you can get away with using something like WD-40 to extend the life of the switch, I would recommend doing that. Since I am tired of the cheap Omron switches, I took matters into my own hands.

This mouse is overly complicated and keeps repairability for the average consumer low. If the scroll wheel needs to be replaced, you're looking at a full teardown. Replace a switch? You need to have the equipment and knowhow to solder on a new switch after a complete disassembly. The G602 and G304 were both much simpler for accessing the switches and required considerably less teardown.

After taking every part of the mouse apart, I finally had a board that I needed.

I soldered on the new switches and began reassembling the mouse.

Tested the new switches and they sound/feel much better than the original Omrons.

## Rubber Grip Replacement
One of my biggest gripes with the G604 is the cheap rubber grip for the mouse. There are countless cases on the internet about the rubber falling apart on the G604 after usage. I have been using this mouse daily for a few years now and have had to use superglue to keep the rubber together. While this kind of works, it is really ugly, feels rough, and the integrity of the rubber continues to degrade. There is only so much that the superglue can do to keep this thing from falling apart. It got so bad that the entirety of the rubber started slipping off. I put nearly an entire small tube of superglue into reattaching it. I saw a Reddit comment around a year ago where someone was thinking about bringing their G604 to a leather shop to get the rubber replaced. I have also seen many STLs for 3D printing a shell replacement for the G604. I personally don't like how the replacement shells look, so I decided to give leather a shot! Fair warning: I have never worked with leather before! :)

While taking apart the mouse, I tried my best to keep the rubber intact so that I could use it as a template. While I got some large pieces off easily, they fell apart incredibly easily. Just holding them without the support of the mouse made them literally crumble into pieces. I suspect that the "rubber" used by Logitech is porous and allows for hand oils to penetrate through it. I found the plastic underneath slightly oily (gross.. I know) which supported my theory.

When I took the rubber off, it looked ROUGH. The superglue mixed with the disintegrating rubber turned into a gross and ugly mess.

After sanding it down, it started to look a LITTLE better. I continued to sand it after this picture to remove any remnants of the superglue.

I used paper to create a template for the leather and cut it out. **NOTE:** For anyone trying to do something similar to this, you should make the leather cutout bigger than your paper template. I didn't think it would be simple, but the leather is VERY easy to trim it down after finishing. You can't add material at the end but you can cut it away.

I used Weldwood contact cement to attach the leather to the prepped shell. **NOTE:** You have one shot at attaching the contact cement pieces together. My alignment wasn't perfect which is why I recommend making the leather piece bigger than you think it should be.

After I attached it, I cut out the side button hole. I did not do this before attaching since it helped me align the leather more easily.

The end result was most definitely NOT perfect, but I think for a first attempt it came out pretty good. The leather feels great to hold, and I hope that over time it develops a good patina. I still have a couple attempts worth of leather, so if I ever feel bored I could apply the lessons I learned and redo the mouse once again. Here are the results:

After letting it ventilate (contact cement fumes) for a few days and using it for about a week, it has already started to smooth out and developed a slight patina.

Overall, I am very happy with the results and in person the mouse feels really good to use and looks pretty slick. The closeup images definitely highlight my lack of experience with leatherworking but from afar it's almost pretty. I hope to be able to continue repairing my favorite tech and keeping mostly functioning tech out of the landfill.
